		<h3 text-align="center">Connecting Internet of Things Foundation to your Bluemix App</h3>

		<p class="p">Navigate to the <a href="www.bluemix.net">Bluemix</a> home page.  In the upper
		right hand corner select "Sign Up" or if you already have an account on Bluemix, simply log in.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p class="p">Once you have successfully signed up or signed into Bluemix you will want to navigate to your Bluemix dashboard.  
				The Bluemix dashboard is where you will create your new application.  First, we will select "Create App" under the Cloud Foundry Apps section of our dashboard.  
				</p>
				<img class="image" src="./img/createApp.bmp" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="p">Next we will choose a web or a mobile app.  For this example we will choose a Web App.</p>
				<img class="image" src="./img/webApp.bmp" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="p">Next Bluemix will ask us what we want to start with, for this application we will choose SDK for Node.js</p>
				<img class="image" src="./img/SDKNodejs.bmp" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="p">Finally, we will give our app a name.  For my example I will choose DemoTestApplication, you can name it anything you want.  
				Once you find a name for your application, Bluemix will create it and begin to stage it for you.  Once this process is finished 
				navigate back to your dashboard and scroll down to see your new app.  Go ahead and click on it.  Once we've selected the app you should see a button 
				"ADD A SERVICE OR API", click on it</p>
				<img class="image" src="./img/addService.bmp" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="p">From here we will scroll down to the bottom, the very last section is Internet of Things, and choose Internet of Things.</p>
				<img class="image" src="./img/IoTF.bmp" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="p">On the right pane of the next screen you will be able to choose your Service name, and what plan you would like to use.  Once you've done this 
				Press USE.</p>
				<img class="image" src="./img/IoTFSetup.bmp" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="p">It will probably ask you to restage your application, if it does say yes you'd like to restage.  
				Return to the dashboard and select your application again once it's finished restaging, once you've opened 
				your application you should now see Internet of Things as an associated service.</p>
				<img class="image" src="./img/IoTFService.bmp" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="p">From here we will select will select Launch dashboard from the left pane of options.</p>
				<img class="image" src="./img/launchDashboard.bmp" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="p">Once the dashboard has launched we, navigate to the ACCESS tab, this will open more tabs, select API KEYS and click Generate API Key</p>
				<img class="image" src="./img/genApiKey.bmp" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="p">This step is very important, once the API Key is generated you will want to copy the information and save it somewhere for your own personal reference.  
				This information cannot be recovered, but if needed you can go back and delete and recreate a new API Key.  Once you've copied the information, click generate.  
				Now that your key is generated you are ready to begin adding devices to the IoT Foundation, the process to do that can be found <a href="./html/addDevice.html">here</a></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="p">Once you've added your devices to the IoT Foundation you are ready to begin publishing data.  To do this using a Sensortag you can use the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/cee6c09c-a315-4b04-ad14-57d6a60fa8bb/entry/setting_up_the_iot_kit?lang=en">IoT Gateway Kit</a>.  
				The IoT Gateway Kit publishes data using node-red, which you will need to configure to publish to your application.  Those instructions can be found <a href="./html/ibmiotapp.html">here</a>.
